## Description

<br />

<div align="justify"> The JSEQ_scRNAseq® bioinformatics pipeline performs all basic single-cell sequencing analysis and moreover determine higher resolution cell composition by the combinatorial CSSG algorithm involving a great number of iterations of cell cluster specific gene arrays to adjust gene combination to each cluster, where each gene occures in a part of cells inside the cluster and combination of them explain the entire cluster. Our pipeline aids to precisely discover the heterogeneity of cells and help determine cell populations particularly vulnerable to diseases. The pipeline was developed and tested on publicly available data of 812 945 cells. </div>
